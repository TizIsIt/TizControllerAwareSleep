# TizControllerAwareSleep

This program will hibernate the PC if it does not detect any gamepad/controller input within 5 minutes. It started when I want my PC to acts like mobile phone where it would go to sleep if there's no user input for 5mins. You can run this program if you're going to play a game to sleep.

- Simply download the TizControllerAwareSleep.exe and run it
- Alternatively, you can download the .cpp file so you could compile and build it yourself in Visual Studio

- NOTE:
- This only works on Windows PC
- Only works with Xinput controller (Xbox controller). I suppose you could use Xinput wrapper, but I did not test that.
